# uni-study-tool
a web based flash card study tool

this project is aimed to provide an intro into developing my JS skills, as well as helping me study. the goal is to have a modular/configurable site that will have different launchable modules containing material for different courses at different points. essentially i will be just taking textbook questions or professor/TA provided review questions, and putting them in random order, or linking to provided review questions if the course in question has them.

initially i just want it to be functionally sound, and later i may dive into some css to spice up the looks a little bit.
